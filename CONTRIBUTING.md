Contributing
============
Collaboration is the best way to improve open source software. We welcome pull requests. Our license does not require contributing back, so you are free to go in whatever direction you choose. But, at least consider it.

Fork, then clone the repo:

Make tests for your changes, make your changes, push to your fork and submit a pull request.

We like to at least comment on pull requests. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Please be sure to write a [good commit message][commit].

> The type must be one of the following types:
> * feat: A new feature
> * fix: A bug fix
> * docs: Documentation only changes
> * style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, > missing semi-colons, etc)
> * refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
> * perf: A code change that improves performance
> * test: Adding missing tests
> * chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as  documentation generation
